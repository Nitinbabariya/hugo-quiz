# hugo-quiz

![build and deploy](https://github.com/bonartm/hugo-quiz/workflows/build%20and%20deploy/badge.svg)

> A hugo shortcode for writing quizzes with a markdown-like syntax, called [quizdown](https://github.com/bonartm/quizdown-js). 

### ðŸš€ See the [demo](https://bonartm.github.io/hugo-quiz/) based on the hugo learn theme or try the interactive [quizdown live editor](https://bonartm.github.io/quizdown-live-editor/).

- supports markdown text formatting, images and syntax highlighting.
- different [quiz-types](https://github.com/bonartm/quizdown-js/blob/main/docs/syntax.md): single-choice, multiple-choice, sequence.
- support for hints and explanations.
- [options](https://github.com/bonartm/quizdown-js/blob/main/docs/options.md) for color theme, question shuffling, localization.
- mobile friendly with touch support for all question types.


## Installation

1. Copy the content from `demo/layouts/shortcodes/quizdown.html`  into your local `layouts/shortcodes/` folder.
2. Add the `quizdown.js` to your project. For the hugo-learn theme you can copy the content of `demo/layouts/partials/custom-header.html` into your local `layouts/partials/` folder.

**Currently, the `--minify` flag of the hugo command causes issues with the raw quizdown-markdown code. Please remove the flag when building your website or use the following option in your `config.toml`**:

```toml
[minify]
  disableHTML = true
```
